    "Whenever you stand on a fork, make a decision and never look back because a wise man once said, there are no right decisions, you make decisions right.",

    "Knowing what you don’t know is much more useful in life and business than being brilliant.",

    "Opportunities will take you somewhere fast, strategy will take you somewhere far.",

    "The difference between skilled people and successful people is that merely skilled people try to go on their own without other people's help/money. The truly succesful people use other people's help. Leveraging and convincing other people to lend [money/time/energy/talent] is how successful people build companies, political parties, charity organizations and successful investments.",

    "Better outcomes are more likely if you have an honest valuation of your own talents and skills. You can generally have success on your own terms through the right combination of strategy, dedication, and earnest self-improvement, but to improve oneself requires a frank and honest inventory of one’s shortcomings. Anything short of that, and you’re simply advancing via coincidence and living on borrowed time.",

    "The solutions you can see to a problem will always be limited by the tools you know. Learning new tools means looking at problems from other angles.",

    "Also, tools are dumb and only as good as you are.",

    "If you're not making mistakes, you aren't working on hard enough problems and that is a big mistake.",

    "It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.",

    "Happiness is a talent we develop, not an object we seek."
